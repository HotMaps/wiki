# Guidelines for using the Hotmaps toolbox for analyses at national level

These guidelines describe how the Hotmaps toolbox can be used to analyse costs and potentials for efficient and renewable heating and cooling at national level. The guide is especially oriented towards the development of results according to the comprehensive assessment of national heating and cooling potentials referred to in Article 14(1) of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED) in its current version.

# Part I: Overview of heating and cooling

The Hotmaps database and toolbox provides two different inputs to this part: first, the Hotmaps database provides default data for several of the data needed to include in this part I of the comprehensive assessment. Second, the Hotmaps toolbox is basically a mapping tool that allows a geographical representation of default data in the toolbox but also of other data uploaded to the toolbox. In the following we describe the different default data form Hotmaps that might be of use and we link to the descriptions of how to use the upload function of the Hotmaps toolbox.

The following data relevant for Part I of Annex VIII is available in the Hotmaps database:

* Point 2: current heating and cooling supply
  * (b) (v) industrial installations:
    * DB – Industrial sites
 * DB – Industrial sites excess heat
 * DB – Industrial sites company names 
 * DB – Industial sites …
* All other:
* No default data is contained for supply points, but own data can uploaded and displayed
* How to create an account
* How to upload own data to the toolbox
* Point 3: a map covering the entire national territory
* (a) Heating and cooling demand areas (not for industrial demand)
* DB – Heat density residential
* DB – Heat density non-residential
* DB – Heat density total
* (b) + (c) Existing and planned supply points
* No default data is contained for supply points, but own data can uploaded and displayed
* How to create an account
* How to upload own data to the toolbox
* Point 4: forecast of trends in the demand for heating and cooling
* Default scenarios for all EU28 MS are available from the H2020 project CHEETAH
* This data is also integrated in the CM – Demand projection and used for the calculations in this module
