# How to use the hotmaps toolbox for heating and cooling planning 

**Welcome to the Hotmaps wiki!**

The Hotmaps WIKI hosts the documentation, guidance and manual of the Hotmaps toolbox. It consists of three main parts:
1. [General toolbox functionalities](#General-tool-functionalities-and-structure),
2. [Calculation modules](#Calculation-modules),
3. [Developers](Developers) section.

General toolbox functionalities guide the user through the interface of the toolbox. The section covers all general aspects of the toolbox, which are related to the user experience, e.g. navigating through different parts of the toolbox, layer selection, retrieving indicators, data upload and export functionalities etc.

The calculation module section, on the other hand, provides an in-depth explanation of concepts and methodologies behind the calculation modules. Besides the explanation of the methodology, the provided examples and test runs for each calculation module help the user to obtain understanding of input parameters and obtained results. Currently, only few calculation modules have been integrated into the toolbox. The calculation module section will expand further by integration of new calculation modules.

The developers section contains all information required for developers to contribute to the Hotmaps toolbox or to understand how it works. It explains amongst all the IT infrastructure of the Hotmaps toolbox, data set integration, contribution in calculation module development etc.

**The Hotmaps WIKI is a living document**, i.e. it grows as the Hotmaps toolbox grows. The Hotmaps developers continue updating Hotmaps WIKI pages by introduction of new updates, improvements, functionalities and calculation modules.

We hope you enjoy exploring the toolbox and find it helpful for your heating and cooling planning!
