**Welcome to the Hotmaps wiki!**

The wiki consists of 2 parts.

1) A handbook on how to apply the Hotmaps toolbox

2) A documentation of individual functionalities and calculation modules within the Hotmaps toolbox.

For developers please see more information here [Developers](Developers)

We hope you enjoy exploring the toolbox and find it helpful for your heating and cooling planning
