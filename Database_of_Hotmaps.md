# Database of Hotmaps

## Summary

The database built for Hotmaps is a spatial Data Warehouse made available to the platform for visualization and computation purposes.

There are different kinds of data:

- raster datasets (at hectare level)
- vector datasets (NUTS/LAU regions, points of interest, ...)
- non-spatial datasets (mostly NUTS/LAU related and linked to existing vector layers)

The datasets can be accessed via a geospatial server (GeoServer) which provides different services (WMS/WFS/...) that allows anyone to display, include or use those datasets.
