**Each layer has a set of tools as shown below**

![layers_tools.png][layers_tools]

1. Shows the symbology section of the layer (legend)
2. Shows the information section (primary a link to the GitLab repository, it is highly recommended to look for more information about the data in the [GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.com/hotmaps) )
3. Download the layer for the selected region(s)
4. Redircets you to the GitLab repository to download the whole layer

# Layers
There are [two categories of layers](https://www.gislounge.com/geodatabases-explored-vector-and-raster-data):  
1. Vector Layers
2. Raster Layers

Following layers can be found and visualized (you can see also the legend and also the information section of each layer):
