*Solar PV potential*

It aims to compute the photovoltaic energy potential and the financial feasibility of a selected area by considering:
- the installation of new PV systems on a percentage of building footprint
- the financial feasibility of new plants

The output of the module are:

- the total cost of covering the selected area with PV panels [currency]
- the total yearly energy production [MWh/year]
- the Levelized Cost of Energy  [currency/kWh]
- a raster file with the most suitable roofs for PV energy production

Starting from the available area and the kind of PV technology the module computes the PV energy production under the following assumptions:
- optimal inclination of the PV system
- area of the PV modules equal to the percentage of the building footprint chosen by the user
- unique selected technology for all the installed PV systems
- default system efficiency equal to 0.75 

These assumptions have been done in order to consider a planning phase for a region and not the design of a specific PV systems.

The yearly energy output is  derived by considering the spatial distribution of yearly solar radiation on the building footprint.
 
The PV energy production is computed for a single representative plant as:

 E_{el,pv,out}=E_{pv} W_{pv} f_{pv} /I_{ref}

with
E_{el,pv,out}  yearly energy output [kWh]
E_{pv} mean yearly solar irradiation [kWh m^{-2}] 
W_{pv} average installed peak power per plant [kW_p] 
f_{pv} system efficiency [-] 
I_{ref} is the solar radiation at Standard Test Condition equal to 1 kW  m^{-2}

The most representative installed peak power for a PV system is an input of the module.
Consequently, the surface covered by a single plant is computed as:

A_{pv} = W_{pv} k_{pv} 

with 
K_{pv} module efficiency at Standard Test Conditions [kW  m^{-2}]
A_{pv} surface of a representative PV system [m^{2}] 

The default module efficiency at Standard Test Conditions is 0.15.

The total number of plants is computed as:

N_{plants} = f_{roof}  f_{buildings}  A_{bui} / A_{pv}

with 
f_{roof} effective building roof utilization factor
A_{pv} fraction of buildings with solar panels } [-] 
A_{bui} building footprint computed from the input raster file [-] 

The total energy production of the selected area is equal to:

E_{el,pv,out} N_{plants}
 
The most suitable area is computed by considering the roofs with higher energy production. 
The energy production of each pixel considers to cover only a fraction of the roofs equal to f_roof. The integral of the energy production of the most suitable area is equal to the total energy production of the selected area.
