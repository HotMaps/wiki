## Introduction
The district heating supply module is a dispatch model which tries to find a cost optimum solution for covering the heat demand at every hour of the year.

&gt; The method described here is to be understood as a first concept and can deviate from the actual implementation (model complexity, inputs and outputs, etc. must be seen from this point of view).

## Inputs and outputs

### Main inputs
1. Heat demand of the grid (selected region)
1. Installed capacities of heat generators/storage
1. Technical(en-efficiencies) and fincancal paramters(opex,capex,lifetime) of heat generators/storages
1. Profiles (time series of the heat demand,solar radiation, temperature, electricity prices, etc..)
1. ...

### Main outputs
* Heat generation costs
* Investment, operation and fuel costs
* Heat generation mix per heat generator
* CO2 Emissions
* Full Load Hours, 
* etc..

## Method
The module is implemented as a linear program and can be used on the one hand as a pure dispatch model and on the other hand for investment planning to cover a load profile.
The objective function tries to find the minimum of the difference from the costs for providing the heat and revenues from electricity production.

### Equation fragments of the linear program:

![lp_fragment.png][lp_fragment]

#### The total costs <code>c<sub>total</sub></code> yield from the sum of:
 
##### investment costs <code>IC</code> (installed capacities multiplied by the annuities of the specific investment costs)

##### captial costs <code>CC</code> :

##### the variable costs <code>OPEX</code> :

##### ramp costs of CHP and waste incineration plants (rough Estimation) :

##### assumed costs for the peak electrical load in the winter time (rough Estimation):

#### The total revenues <code>rev<sub>total</sub></code> yield from::

##### the sale of electricity (for example from CHP plants and waste incineration plants).:
