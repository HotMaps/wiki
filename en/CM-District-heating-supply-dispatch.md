## In a glance
This module can be run in two modes: 1)dispatch, 2)invest. In the dispatch mode, it calculates the cost-minimal operation of a portfolio of heat supply technologies in a defined district heating system for each hour of the year. The inputs to the module are hourly profiles for the heat demand in the network, for the potential heat supply from different sources and for energy carrier prices. Furthermore, cost and efficiency parameters for each technology are required. The module yields the costs of heat supply, the share of energy carriers used and the implied CO2 emissions. In the invest mode, the module optimizes the capacities of installed heat supply technologies to cover heat demand.

## Introduction
This module can be run in two modes: 1) dispatch, 2) invest. In the dispatch mode, it calculates the cost-minimal operation of a portfolio of heat supply technologies in a defined district heating system for each hour of the year. The inputs to the module are hourly profiles for the heat demand in the network, for the potential heat supply from different sources and for energy carrier prices. Furthermore, cost and efficiency parameters for each technology are required. The module yields the costs of heat supply, the share of energy carriers used and the implied CO2 emissions. In the invest mode, the module optimizes the capacities of installed heat supply technologies to cover heat demand.

The district heating supply dispatch module is a dispatch model which tries to find a cost optimum solution for covering the heat demand at every hour of the year.

The method described here is to be understood as a first concept and can deviate from the actual implementation (model complexity, inputs and outputs, etc. must be seen from this point of view). This wiki page, explains the the version of calculation module that is integrated to the toolbox. A **stand-alone version** of the calculation module is much more comprehensive and can be downloaded from **[HERE](https://github.com/tuw-eeg/hotmapsDispatch)**. This version requires however, basic knowledge of python programming. The **documentation** of the stand-alone version can be found **[HERE](https://hotmapsdispatch.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**.

## Inputs and outputs

### Main inputs
The module requires a long array of input parameters. The main input parameters are however:
1. Heat demand of the grid (selected region)
1. Installed capacities of heat generators/storage
1. Technical(en-efficiencies) and financial parameters(opex,capex,lifetime) of heat generators/storages
1. Profiles (time series of the heat demand, solar radiation, temperature, electricity prices, etc..)


### Main outputs
The main output indicators of the calculation module are:
* Heat generation costs
* Investment, operation and fuel costs
* Heat generation mix per heat generator
* CO2 Emissions
* Full Load Hours, 


**IMPORTANT NOTE** In Hotmaps biomass emissions are not assumed zero because Hotmaps is a tool aimed at supporting the ongoing energy transition. Considering biomass as a carbon-neutral source of energy implies that burning biomass reduces the current total emissions compared to burning fossil fuels, which is not true. The storage of carbon dioxide in trees happens over decades, while its release in the atmosphere takes place all at once. Therefore, the net carbon balance of biomass is zero in the long run, but not in the short run and climate change mitigation measures need to bring results in reducing carbon emissions in the short run.

## Method
The module is implemented as a linear program and can be used on the one hand as a pure dispatch model and on the other hand for investment planning to cover a load profile.
The objective function tries to find the minimum of the difference from the costs for providing the heat and revenues from electricity production.

### Equation fragments of the linear program:

![lp_fragment.png][lp_fragment]

#### The total costs <code>c<sub>total</sub></code> yield from the sum of:
 
##### investment costs <code>IC</code> (installed capacities multiplied by the annuities of the specific investment costs)

##### captial costs <code>CC</code> :

##### the variable costs <code>OPEX</code> :

##### assumed costs for the peak electrical load in the winter time (rough Estimation):

#### The total revenues <code>rev<sub>total</sub></code> yield from::

## Sample run

After you select a region and make no changes to the default parameters, the model will run in investment mode. This means that the installed capacities are also optimized for the optimal cost coverage of the heat demand. 


Below you can see all input parameters that can be changed
