## In a glance
This module calculates the cost-minimal operation of a portfolio of heat supply technologies in a defined district heating system for each hour of the year. The inputs to the module are hourly profiles for the heat demand in the network, for the potential heat supply from different sources and for energy carrier prices. Furthermore, cost and efficiency parameters for each technology are required. The module yields the costs of heat supply, the share of energy carriers used and the implied CO2 emissions. The module can also be used to optimise the capacities of installed heat supply technologies.

## Introduction
The district heating supply module is a dispatch model which tries to find a cost optimum solution for covering the heat demand at every hour of the year.

&gt; The method described here is to be understood as a first concept and can deviate from the actual implementation (model complexity, inputs and outputs, etc. must be seen from this point of view).

## Inputs and outputs

### Main inputs
1. Heat demand of the grid (selected region)
1. Installed capacities of heat generators/storage
1. Technical(en-efficiencies) and financial parameters(opex,capex,lifetime) of heat generators/storages
1. Profiles (time series of the heat demand, solar radiation, temperature, electricity prices, etc..)
1. ...

### Main outputs
* Heat generation costs
* Investment, operation and fuel costs
* Heat generation mix per heat generator
* CO2 Emissions
* Full Load Hours, 
* etc..

**IMPORTANT NOTE** Biomass emissions are not assumed zero in this and other calculation modules. The storage of carbon dioxide in trees happens over decades, while its release in the atmosphere takes place all at once. Therefore, the net carbon balance of biomass is zero in the long run, but positive in the short run. Hotmaps is aimed at supporting the ongoing energy transition and considering biomass carbon neutral would be a potential step backwards for climate change mitigation efforts.

## Method
The module is implemented as a linear program and can be used on the one hand as a pure dispatch model and on the other hand for investment planning to cover a load profile.
The objective function tries to find the minimum of the difference from the costs for providing the heat and revenues from electricity production.

### Equation fragments of the linear program:

![lp_fragment.png][lp_fragment]

#### The total costs <code>c<sub>total</sub></code> yield from the sum of:
 
##### investment costs <code>IC</code> (installed capacities multiplied by the annuities of the specific investment costs)

##### captial costs <code>CC</code> :

##### assumed costs for the peak electrical load in the winter time (rough Estimation):

#### The total revenues <code>rev<sub>total</sub></code> yield from::

## Sample run

After you select a region and make no changes to the default parameters, the model will run in investment mode. This means that the installed capacities are also optimized for the optimal cost coverage of the heat demand.
