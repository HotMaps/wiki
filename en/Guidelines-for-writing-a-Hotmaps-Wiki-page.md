## Introduction

The Hotmaps Wiki platform, provides flexible functionalities for creating and editing the Wiki pages. In order to be able to create or modify any Wiki page, you must be logged in to the Wiki platform. This is only possible if you have a GitHub account and you are assigned a Wiki provider permission. To get a permission, send an Email to "support(at)hotmaps.eu" including your GitHub ID. We will then evaluate your request and accordingly respond to it. In order to log in, use the top-right corner login button. Once you are logged in, you can create and modify the pages.

## Wiki toolbar
On top of each page you see the edit toolbar. The figure below shows this toolbar and briefly explains the function of each button.

## Classification of Wiki pages

The Hotmaps Wiki pages are categorized in four classes:
* Hotmaps data set repository structure
* General Functionalities of the toolbox
* Calculation Modules
* How to apply the Hotmaps toolbox
* Developers area

For each section, a structure with several sections is suggested. The sections in **BOLD** must be part of the Wiki page. The rest, on the other hand, should be added if applicable.
As a sample page, please have a look into [this Wiki page](/en/CM-District-heating-potential-areas-user-defined-thresholds).

Wiki pages can become very long due to embedded figures. In order to help the readers to navigate in a page easily and easily find what they are looking for, please add a “**Table of contents**” on top of each page that you are writing. Additionally, use a “[**`To Top`**](#table-of-contents)” button at the end of each section with a hyperlink to the “Table of content” at the top of the Wiki page.

In case you should use your own figures, please first create a new folder for your wiki page here and then push all the figures into the folder. Please also avoid using bulky images as the repository has a limited capacity.

Once you finished writing your Wiki page, ask your colleagues to review your page and give feedback to you. In this way, we can minimize the written mistakes and make sure that Wiki pages are written clearly. Add the name of the reviewer in the "Authors and reviewers" section. Follow the same structure as of the provided sample page.


**NOTE**: The Wiki pages are usually written in Markdown language (some additional formats are also possible). If you are not familiar with Markdown, read [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) the short tutorial provided by GitHub.
