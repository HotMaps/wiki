## In a glance
This module scales the default layer with a given factor. The aim is to provide a distribution of heat and cold demand if only the total amount of heat and cold demand is available.

## Introduction

The aim of the calculation module is to quickly obtain a new raster by scaling a raster density map by a user-chosen factor. It generates a new raster by multiplying each cell of the input raster by the given factor.

## Inputs and outputs

The input parameters and layers, as well as output layers and parameters, are as follows.

**Input layers and parameters are:**

* Multiplication factor [-]: a real value between _*0*_ and _*1000*_
  * if the multiplication factor is > 1, the output raster is greater than the input. 
  * if the multiplication factor is < 1, the output raster is smaller than the input.
* The layer to be scaled :
  * Heat or Cool density map in raster format (\*.tif)

**Output layers and parameters are:**

* An output raster (\*.tif), corresponding to the input scaled by the multiplication factor.

## Method
Each cell's value of the input raster is multiplied by the multiplication factor.

## Application
If we know the total consumption of an area, and the indicator _Total head demand_ does not correspond this value, it is possible to scale the heat demand by the ratio (Total_real / Total_default).
The following figure gives the example of a multiplication factor value of 0.5.

## Sample run

Here, the calculation module is run for the case study of Vienna, Austria. First, use the "Go To Place" bar to navigate to Vienna and select the city. Click on the "Layers" button to open the "Layers" window and then click on the "CALCULATION MODULE" tab. In the list of calculation modules, select "CM - Scale heat and cool density maps". 

### Test Run: default input values
After pressing run a new density map is calculated on the basis of the selected map. The default value here is the heat density total map. 
After the calculation, the total new heat demand is shown on the right side, under indicators. (Here the default value is 1 and therefore no changes occur).

After closing the calculation modules and switching to the layer section, the newly calculated heat density map can be found on the very bottom. It can be downloaded and uploaded again to save it or use it in further calculations.
