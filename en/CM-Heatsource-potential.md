# In a glance

This module generates a shapefile classifying the heat source potential based on the distance of the heat source from the demand, and based on the capacity of the heatsource. Each heat source is classified in three main classes:
- suitable
- conditionally suitable
- not suitable.
The module automatize the methodology as defined by:
