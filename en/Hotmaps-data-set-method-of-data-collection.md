## Data collection
Hotmaps provides a large array of open data sets. The data has been provided as default for the entire EU28 with the aim to support local, regional and national heating and cooling (H&amp;C) planning. Hotmaps data sets provide data various categories including:

* Building stock analysis;
* Space heating, cooling and domestic hot water demand;
* Climate context;
* Industrial processes;
* Heating and cooling supply;
* Renewable energy sources data collection and potential review;
* Hourly loads profiles;
* Electricity system module and
* Transport.

All the approaches for data collection and analysis in the different sectors (i.e. residential, service, industrial and transportation sectors) are described in [this report](https://www.hotmaps-project.eu/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/D2.3-Hotmaps_for-upload_revised-final_.pdf) [1].
