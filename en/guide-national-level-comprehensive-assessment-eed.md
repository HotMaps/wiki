# Introduction

These guidelines describe how the Hotmaps database and toolbox can be used to analyse potentials, costs, and emissions for efficient and renewable heating and cooling at local level.

# Overview of the Hotmaps scenario toolchain

For calculating scenarios of potential future heating demand and supply in the city and the related costs and emissions we use the Hotmaps toolbox. In the toolbox various calculation modules (CMs) are contained for analysing different parts of the heating and cooling systems. The following figure shows the different CMs (in light blue) that were used and the information that was created from or feeding into the CMs.
