## Introduction
This is the second step of the analysis at national level.

## Calculation of decentral heat supply

In the third step, the costs and emissions of heat supply via decentral technologies are calculated. This calculation should be performed for different representative buildings in the country/region of interest. While for district heating representative cities/areas have been developed in step 1 of the approach, typical buildings in each EU Member State data can be found in the Hotmaps default database. Also, for many EU countries detailed building typologies (building archetypes) with data on heat demand before and after renovation can be found in statistics and literature.

The CM - Decentral heating supply can be used to calculate the costs and emissions of heat supply via different decentral technologies. The module uses data on heat demand as well as data on costs of technologies and prices for energy carriers to calculate the levelized costs of heat supply [EUR/MWh] for the different technologies in the different typical buildings and renovation states. The following figure shows this procedure graphically and shows the various data sources feeding into the CM - Decentral heating supply.

The calculations can be used to identify costs and benefits of various supply technologies in different representative buildings and their sensitivity to important influencing parameters like energy carrier and CO2 prices or interest rate and depreciation time.

The outcomes of this step are the costs of heat supply via decentral technologies [EUR/MWh] in each of the representative buildings and the related CO2 emissions [kt/yr]. These results will then be used in the overall scenario comparison in step 4.
