1. Shows the symbology section of the layer (legend)

2. Shows the information section (primary a link to the GitLab repository, it is highly recommended to look for more information about the data in the [GitLab Repository](https://gitlab.com/hotmaps) )

3. Download the layer for the selected region(s)

4. Redircets you to the GitLab repository to download the whole layer
