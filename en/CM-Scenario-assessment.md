## Calculation module scenario comparison

In the following, required indicators from each calculation module for the "**calculation module scenario comparison** are enumerated. These indicators should be saved for each scenario tag and later on, be shown in the scenario assessment tool.

### CM - Customized heat and floor area density maps

* Total floor area in _*m<sup>2</sup>*_
* Total heat demand in _*MWh*_



### CM - Demand projection

* Total floor area in _*m<sup>2</sup>*_
* Total heat demand in _*MWh*_


### CM - Heat load profiles



### CM - District heating potential areas: user-defined thresholds

* Total heat demand in potential district heating areas in *_MWh_*
* Share of heat demand in district heating areas from the total heat demand in the selected area in _*%*_

### CM - District heating potential: economic assessment

* District heating potential in the last year of the investment in _*MWh*_
* Share of heat demand in district heating areas from the total heat demand in the selected area in _*%*_
* Average specific **distribution** grid cost in economic district heating areas in _*EUR/MWh*_

### CM - District heating supply dispatch

* Energy carrier mix in form of stacked bar chart:
  * Consumption level in _*MWh*_
  * CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in _*tons/year*_ per energy carrier
  * Overall supply cost in _*EUR/MWh*_ for the whole carrier mix: CAPEX + OPEX + Energy Costs

```
Note: the supply cost in scenario assessment may become very large if we show it in form of bar charts for all energy carriers. It shall be disscussed further for the implementation.
```

### CM - Decentral heating supply - City level

* Energy carrier mix in form of stacked bar chart:
  * Referenced heat cost for the whole energy carrier mix in _*EUR/MWh*_: CAPEX + OPEX + Energy Costs
  * Decentral heating CO<sub>2</sub> emission per energy carrier in _*tons/year*_
* Weighted average levelized cost of heat for the building stock in _*EUR/MWh*_


### CM - Excess heat transport potential

* Available Excess heat potential in _*MWh*_
* Cost of excess heat in _*EUR/MWh*_

## Overall scenario assessment

The indicators for this part originate from two calculation modules:

1. CM - Decentral heating supply
1. CM - District heating supply dispatch

For each scenario tag, the following three indicators are shown in form of **stacked bar chart**:

* Overall (aggregated) costs of heat supply by **district heating system** and **decentral heating system** in _*EUR*_
* Overall (aggregated) CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by **district heating system** and **decentral heating system** in _*tons/year*_
* Overall energy carrier mix in _*MWh*_
