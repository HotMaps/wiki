## In a glance

This module allows comparing up to 10 different scenarios. The module is not integrated into the Hotmaps Toolbox, but it is provided as a separate Excel sheet that combines the results of other calculation modules which must be previously run.

## Introduction

This module offers a quick comparison of scenarios, based on the results of the following calculation modules: Decentral heating supply, District heating potential: economic assessment, and District heating supply dispatch. These modules must be run independently for each scenario under consideration, then the results shall be reported in the Excel Workbook by compiling the relevant sheet. Bear in mind that in order to have the input for the above-mentioned calculation modules, other modules must be previously run, as specified below in the **[Calculation module: Scenario assessment inputs](#calculation-module-scenario-assessment-inputs)**. The overall indicators are calculated and shown in the sheet "Final Tabel" both in the form of a table and charts: cost per year, levelized costs, CO2 emissions, final energy, useful energy, and RES/DH shares.

## Calculation module - Scenario assessment inputs

In the following, the required indicators from each calculation module needed for the "**Calculation module - Scenario assessment**" are enumerated. These indicators should be saved for each scenario tag and later on, be compiled in the scenario assessment workbook.

### [CM - District heating potential: economic assessment](#CM-District-heating-potential-economic-assessment)

### [CM - District heating supply dispatch](https://wiki.hotmaps.hevs.ch/edit/en/CM-District-heating-potential-economic-assessment)

### [CM - Decentral heating supply - City level]()

## Overall scenario assessment

The indicators for this part originate from two calculation modules:

1. CM - Decentral heating supply
1. CM - District heating potential: economic assessment
1. CM - District heating supply dispatch

For each scenario tag, the following three indicators are shown in the form of **stacked bar chart**:

* Overall (aggregated) costs of heat supply by **district heating system** and **decentral heating system** in _*M EUR/year*_
* Overall (aggregated) CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by **district heating system** and **decentral heating system** in _*tons/year*_
* Overall energy carrier mix in _*MWh*_
* Overal (aggregated) final energy and useful energy in _*GWh/year*_
