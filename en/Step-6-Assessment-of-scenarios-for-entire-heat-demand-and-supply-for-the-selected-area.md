## Introduction
This is the last step of the analysis at local and municipal level.

*Figure: The steps to assess different scenarios for the entire heat demand and supply are highlighted in the Toolchain above.*

## Comparison of results for different scenarios
The final step in the analysis is the comparison of the results for the different scenarios and sensitivities. For this, all results calculated in the previous steps are collected both from the calculations of district heating as well as from the calculations of decentral supply and compared against each other for main indicators. The [CM - Scenario Assessment](https://wiki.hotmaps.hevs.ch/en/CM-Scenario-assessment) allows to easily combine and compare all relevant data, its approach is illustrated in the following figure.
