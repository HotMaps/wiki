## Step 6: Assessment of scenarios for entire heat demand and supply for the selected area

### Comparison of results for different scenarios
The final step in the analysis is the comparison of the results for the different scenarios and sensitivities. For this, all results calculated in the previous steps are collected both from the calculations of district heating as well as from the calculations of decentral supply and compared against each other for main indicators. This can be done in the CM - Scenario Assessment. The following figure shows this approach.
