## In a glance

This module calculates the energy potential from different biomass sources (forest and agricultural residues) within a NUTS3 region.

## Introduction

This module assess the potential biomass energy that can be generated from a biomass source.
The aims of this CM is to assess the electric and thermal energy that can be used from the biomass potential of NUTS3 regions. The module considers different typology of biomass that can be exploit to produce energy.
The CM uses the default data set for the whole EU that are at NUTS3 level.

## Method

The module calculates for each available biomass resource the percentage of the total amount of biomass that can be effectively and realistically be collected. These values are provided by user as input. In providing these values, user should consider parameters such as forestry ground conditions (e.g. slope, terrain roughness) and the mechanization of the process (e.g. use of cable crane, harvester and forwarder, etc.) in order to provide a realistic estimation.
Based on the provided transformation efficiency, the energy that can be extracted from each biomass resource is calculated. Finally, the total biomass heat energy potential and total biomass electric energy potential are obtained.
