<h1>CM Customized heat and gross floor area density maps</h1>


## In a glance
This module generates both a heat density and a floor area density map in the form of raster files. The inputs to the module are either a shapefile with required data in its attribute table or a CSV file. The input data should be sufficient for calculating floor area and heat demand densities. For example, X-coordinate and Y-coordinate of the center of buildings that in case of shapefile, will be automatically calculated; heat demand of buildings or specific heat demand and its floor area. Instead of floor areas, the building footprint and number of floors can be provided.

This module will only be available as stand-alone module; it will not be integrated into the toolbox.
