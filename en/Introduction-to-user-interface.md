## Introduction Page 
Once the toolbox is opened, the disclaiming page is shown ([Fig.1](#fig1)). Besides the disclaimer message, additional information regarding the objectives of the Hotmaps toolbox as well as the link to the Hotmaps project website and the data repositories is provided.

_Fig. 1 Short introduction to Hotmas toolbox_


The Hotmaps GUI is a GIS-based interface. By closing the disclaiming page, the user sees the map of Europe. By default, the heat demand density map of EU-28 countries and NUTS 3 layer is depicted. In addition to these two maps, some tools and buttons can be seen in GUI. These tools are illustrated in [Fig.2](#fig2)

Here you can spot at first glance 3 parts of the user interface:
1. [a toolbar at the top](#upper-toolbar)
2. the map itself
3. [and some tools for changing the style of the map](#tiles)

In the following chapters we will have a look at each of these 3 parts:
