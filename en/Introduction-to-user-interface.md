## Introduction Page 
Once the toolbox is opened, the disclaiming page is shown. Besides the disclaimer message, additional information regarding supported browsers, the objectives of the Hotmaps project, the link to the Hotmaps project website and the data repositories is provided.

_Fig. 1 Short introduction to Hotmaps toolbox_


The Hotmaps GUI is a GIS-based interface. By closing the disclaiming page, the user sees the map of Europe. By default, the heat demand density map of EU-28 countries and NUTS 2 boundaries are depicted. In addition to these two maps, some tools and buttons can be seen in GUI. These tools are illustrated in the following figure.

<a name="Fig2">![first_glance][Fig2] </a>
_Fig. 2 Initial Page_

Here you can spot at first glance 3 parts of the user interface:

1. [a toolbar at the top](#upper-toolbar),
1. the map itself,
1. [and some tools for changing the style of the map](#tiles).

In the following chapters, these 3 parts are explained in detail.
