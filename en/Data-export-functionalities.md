## Introduction

The Hotmaps toolbox allows anyone to export part of a layer/dataset.

This feature requires basic usage knowledge on selection and layers. 

If you have any difficulties please read the following guides:

- [How to select a region in the Hotmaps toolbox](Select-a-region-in-the-Hotmaps-toolbox)
- [Layer selection](Layers-section-in-the-Hotmaps-toolbox)

## How to export a data set

1. Select the layer you want to export in the list of layers (left panel)

2. Select the selection scale on the right of the map (NUTS/LAU/hectare)

3. Select the the region you want with the selection tools<img src="../images/export_selection.png" alt="export_selection"/>

4. Once the selection is done, click on the <img src="../images/layer-export-btn.png" alt="export button"/> button that appears below the layer name on the left panel to start the download process.

5. Once finished you will get a .tif file on your computer

Once all these steps are done you will have an export of one of the layers.

You can then use it with your own tools and even edit it to import it back to the platform (see [Data upload](Data_upload) for indications on how to do it).
