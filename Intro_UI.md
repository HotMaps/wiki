The Hotmaps GUI is a GIS-based interface. By closing the disclaiming page, the user encounters with the map of Europe. By default, the heat demand density map of EU-28 countries and NUTS 3 layer are depicted. In addition to these two maps, some tools and buttons can be seen in GUI. These tools are illustrated in [Fig. 2][#Fig2]
