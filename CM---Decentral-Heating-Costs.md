## Introduction

The decentral heating cost calclulation module (CM) calculates the levelized cost of heat (LCOH) for the various technologies in residential or service sector. The technologies are as follows:

* Heat pump air-to-air, air-to-water and Brine-to-water,
* Electric heater,
* Bio-oil boiler,
* Oil boiler,
* Biomass automatic and manual,
* Wood stove,
* Natural gas,
* Solar thermal

The results will be shown for the selected building type and building class.

&#x1F53A; <mark>**Note:** The current version on the toolbox is a test version. We are considering to use additional data and expand the functionality of this calculation module. </mark>

## Inputs and outputs
The input parameters and layers as well as output layers and parameters are as follows.

**Input parameters are:**

* Gross floor area of the building in [_**m<sup>2</sup>**_]: a value between _*1*_ and _*10000*_
* Interest rate: a value between _*0*_ and _*1*_
* Sector: residential or service (&#x1F53A; Currently, only residential is supported)
* Building type: single family or multi family house
* Building class: existing, renovated or new building
* Demand type: heating or cooling (&#x1F53A; Currently, only heating is supported)
* Year: (&#x1F53A; Currently, only for the year 2015 is supported)

**Output are:**
* graphs
* indicators
