## At a glance

In the course of the Hotmaps project, a number of free and open access trainings have been held, both on-site and online. This section gathers all the training materials developed in the context of these workshops and courses, with the aim of helping users to learn about the Hompats toolbox and database through a self-paced and self-taught training, and future trainers/workshop hosts to organize future Hotmaps training.

## Introduction

All Hotmaps trainings have been conceived for heating and cooling planning professionals. The training addresses how the Hotmaps database and toolbox are structured and what are their functionalities, but the theory and procedures of heating and cooling planning are assumed as already familiar to participants and are not covered by the training. Those who wish to learn more also on the heating and cooling planning theory, are invited to read the [Hotmaps Handbooks](https://www.hotmaps-project.eu/hotmaps-handbook-and-wiki-released/), possibly before taking the training. No additional preparation is required to be able to complete this training.

The training combines:
  - A presentation of the Hotmaps project. 
  - A virtual tour of the Hotmaps tool.
  - Practical and written exercises, to be performed by the participants based on spreadsheets and explanatory documents.
  - Support, Discussion and Feedback sessions.


The Hotmaps learning material is currently available in English and German. The training is modular and it covers the following functionalities:
  - Mapping of heat demand and resource potentials (exercise 1)
  - Calculation of decentral heat supply costs (exercise 2)
  - Calculation of district heating supply costs (exercise 3)
  - Calculation of district heating distribution costs (exercise 4)
  - Setting up of consistent scenarios for the region (exercise 5)

## Past training workshops and online courses 

There have been two training workshops held in person:
  - Bolzano (IT), December 9 th -10 th 2019 > Done
  - Brussels (BE), February 19 th -20 th 2020 > Done

After the COVID-19 outbreak, the remaining trainings planned in Milton Keynes (UK), April 1st – 2nd, and Frankfurt-am-Main (DE), May 5th – 6th 2020, were cancelled. Thre online courses have been eventually held virtually as countermeasure:
  - First online training in English, April 27th - May 12th 2020
  - Online training in German, May 4th - 19th 2020
  - Second online training in English, stretched over three weeks, June 29th - July 17th 2020

## Guidelines to host a Hotmpas training 

The document on the [Training Materials](link) provides guidelines and examples to assist the performance of further training workshops on the use of the Hotmaps tool, as well as the self-taught training. In addition, it elaborates on practical aspects of organizing and delivering a Hotmaps training, such as training structure, selection of trainers, locations and timing, promotion activities, registration and more. The process of subsequent adjustments due both to the experience and feedback gathered in the first two on-site trainings and to the COVID-19 outbreak, is explained by presenting both the original workshop draft and final agendas, as well as the online trainings agendas, together with the on-site training materials and those later used online.

The document provides also guidelines for a live presentation of the tool, a list of all the available capacity building and educational materials produced, together with their respective use. All the sections of the trainings are explained in details and the training material used is illustrated, including the use of an e-learning platform, the exercises hand-outs and their relative solutions. 

Finally, it presents the feedback collected, providing both an overview of how the trainings were received, and how future trainings could build on this experience.
