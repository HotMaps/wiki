## At a glance

In the course of the Hotmaps project, a number of free and open access trainings have been held, both on-site and online. This section gathers all the training materials developed in the context of these workshops and courses, with the aim of helping users to learn about the Hompats toolbox and database through a self-paced and self-taught training, and future trainers/workshop hosts to organize future Hotmaps training.

## Introduction

All Hotmaps trainings have been conceived for heating and cooling planning professionals. The training addresses how the Hotmaps database and toolbox are structured and what are their functionalities, but the theory and procedures of heating and cooling planning are assumed as already familiar to participants and are not covered by the training. Those who wish to learn more also on the heating and cooling planning theory, are invited to read the [Hotmaps Handbooks](https://www.hotmaps-project.eu/hotmaps-handbook-and-wiki-released/), possibly before taking the training. No additional preparation is required to be able to complete this training.

The training combines:
  - A presentation of the Hotmaps project. 
  - A virtual tour of the Hotmaps tool.
  - Practical and written exercises, to be performed by the participants based on spreadsheets and explanatory documents.
  - Support, Discussion and Feedback sessions.


The Hotmaps learning material is currently available in English and German. The training is modular and it covers the following functionalities:
  - Mapping of heat demand and resource potentials (exercise 1)
  - Calculation of decentral heat supply costs (exercise 2)
  - Calculation of district heating supply costs (exercise 3)
  - Calculation of district heating distribution costs (exercise 4)
  - Setting up of consistent scenarios for the region (exercise 5)

## Past training workshops and online courses 

There have been two training workshops held in person:
  - Bolzano (IT), December 9 th -10 th 2019 > Done
  - Brussels (BE), February 19 th -20 th 2020 > Done

After the COVID-19 outbreak, the remaining trainings planned in Milton Keynes (UK), April 1st – 2nd, and Frankfurt-am-Main (DE), May 5th – 6th 2020, were cancelled. Thre online courses have been eventually held virtually as countermeasure:
  - First online training in English, April 27th - May 12th 2020
  - Online training in German, May 4th - 19th 2020
  - Second online training in English, stretched over three weeks, June 29th - July 17th 2020

## Guidelines to host a Hotmpas training 

The document on the [Training Materials](link) provides guidelines and examples to assist the performance of further training workshops on the use of the Hotmaps tool, as well as the self-taught training. In addition, it elaborates on practical aspects of organizing and delivering a Hotmaps training, such as training structure, selection of trainers, locations and timing, promotion activities, registration and more. The process of subsequent adjustments due both to the experience and feedback gathered in the first two on-site trainings and to the COVID-19 outbreak, is explained by presenting both the original workshop draft and final agendas, as well as the online trainings agendas, together with the on-site training materials and those later used online.

The document provides also guidelines for a live presentation of the tool, a list of all the available capacity building and educational materials produced, together with their respective use. All the sections of the trainings are explained in details and the training material used is illustrated, including the use of an e-learning platform, the exercises hand-outs and their relative solutions. 

Finally, it presents the feedback collected, providing both an overview of how the trainings were received, and how future trainings could build on this experience.

###Introductory webinar, one week before the intensive training (1 hour)
This webinar was meant to welcome the participants, present the trainers, the Hotmaps project, Hotmpas toolbox, the structure and modality of the training, and the e-learning platform. All webinars were provided with Microsoft Teams.
After registering for the training and receiving the welcome email with the links for the webinars, this was the first time that the participants had a chance to get in touch with the trainers.
We informed the participants that all future communications would be delivered through the e-learning platform Google Classroom. During the webinar, the first material was posted on the platform: a short tutorial presenting the Hotmaps toolbox at a glance, two introductory videos, respectively on strategic heating and cooling planning and on the Hotmaps database, and a link to the first multiple answers test, based on the content of the videos. The test was provided through Google Forms, with deadline at the end of the week. Also, the webinar’s presentation and recording were posted the same day.
 
The link to the Hotmaps handbooks was originally provided only in the welcome email and in the introductory webinar presentation, and then, after some participants reported that they could have used more theory around the heating and cooling planning, it was added to the introductory material.

###Introduction to the use of the tool, exercises 1 - 2
This was the first webinar of the intensive training. We assumed that the participants had accessed the ma
terial posted so far, completed the test and familiarized with the tool. 
The trainers showed how to do the mapping of heat demand and resource potentials and how to calculate the decentral heat supply costs for the scenario under analysis. In order to ease the process of checking the assignments for errors, all participants were required to perform the same calculations on the same municipality: Tomaszów Mazowiecki, a large town in central Poland. 
The material for exercises 1-2 was posted the night before the webinar and it included:
 	A word document, with the instructions to perform the calculations,
 	A spreadsheet, with the parameters to use and the space to paste the results obtained. 
 
This was a good chance to remind participants to accept the email invite to join Google Classrom and to show them again how to use the e-learning platform, in case creating a Google account in case they do not have it.
As the first two exercises were distributed, the participants have been divided in groups of max 15-20 people- Each group has been assigned to one trainer, that was available during each support session to answer questions and help participants complete the exercises. The respective link to the Teams room was also distributed to each participant through the e-learning platform.

###Wrap-up of exercises 1 - 2, introduction to exercises 3 and 4
The trainers showed how exercises 1-2 were supposed to be completed and moved on showing how to calculate the district heating supply costs and distribution costs for the scenario under analysis. 
The material for exercises 3-4 was posted the night before the webinar and it included, as for exercises 1-2, a word document and a spreadsheet to perform the exercise.
This was a good chance to remind participants to do good use of the support sessions.

###Wrap-up of exercises 3 - 4, introduction to exercises 5
The trainers showed how exercises 3-4 were supposed to be completed and moved on showing how to set up a consistent scenario for the region and perform the scenario assessment. 
The material for exercise 5 was posted the night before the webinar and it included, as for the previous assignments, a word document and a spreadsheet to perform the exercise.
This was a good chance to remind participants of the final deadline for completing all the assignments and uploading them through the e-learning platform, as well as to inform them that in order to receive the certificate of attendance, they should have provided their full name and submitted also the feedback questionnaire.

###Closing and explanation of exercises 5, feedback questionnaire, certificates and final remarks
The trainers showed how exercise 5 was supposed to be complete and then addressed the closing of the training. An overview of the feedback received during the support session and through the feedback questionnaire was provided. Additional information was provided regarding the distribution of the certificates of attendance, which were posted on the e-learning platform at the beginning of the following week. The training certificates were provided upon completion of the training, which is to say when all assignments had been submitted. The training did not involve any evaluation of the assignments, but the correct answers of the introductory test and the completed version of exercise 5 were circulated for self-evaluation of the participants.
Because some participants asked to be able to complete the training beyond the deadline, the e-learning platform was kept open for some additional weeks in order to allow all the interested participants to complete the training and receive their certificate.
