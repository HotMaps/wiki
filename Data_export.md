## Introduction

The Hotmaps toolbox allows anyone to export part of a layer/dataset.

This feature requires basic usage knowledge on selection and layers. 

If you have any difficulties please read the following guides:

5. Once finished you will get a .tif file on your computer



Once all these steps are finished you will have an export of one of the layers. 

You can then use it with your own tools and even edit it to import it back to the platform (see [Data upload](Data-upload) for indications on how to do it).
