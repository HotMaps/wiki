### CM - Demand projection

The aim of the calculation module is to transfer the scenario results for the development of the energy demand to different regions.

**The procedure is as follows**

Workflow performed prior to the HotMaps toolbox 
1. Precalculate Invert/EE-Lab results on the Country level
2. Assessment what happens with different types of buildings: Residential and Non-Residential buildings / 3 construction Periods and newly constructed buildings on the country level
3. Assess population growth per NUTS3 region and initial building stock (heated gross floor area / energy needs per construction period and building type) per NUTS 3 region
4. Transfer the NUTS0 scenario results to the NUTS3 level
5. Integrate the NUTS3 level results in the HotMaps Toolbox

Workflow performed within to the HotMaps toolbox
1. Select regions
2. Start Calculation Module, define input parameters
3. For each raster cell, the CM calculates the estimated share of energy and heated gross floor area by building types (eg. residential building, construction period 1, unrefurbished) and apply the measures according to the national/NUTS3 development on those buildings.
4. User interaction: The user can choose to investigate the impact of more or less – relative to the selected scenario - ambitious measures, e.g. choose a higher or lower demolition rate of buildings from a certain construction period.


**Output**

* Tabular results on heated gross floor area per construction period, final energy demand per construction period and derived indicators.
* Bar charts on heated gross floor area and final energy demand per construction period
* Heat density map and map of heated gross floor area
