# CM - Demand projection

The aim of the calculation module is to transfer the scenario results for the development of the energy demand to different regions.

**The procedure is as follows**
1. Underlying Invert/EE-Lab results on the Country level
2. Analysis what happens with different types of buildings: Residential and Non-Residential buildings / 3 construction Periods and newly constructed buildings
3. For each raster cell, calculate the estimated share of energy by distinguished building type (eg. residential building, construction period 1, unrefurbished) and apply the measures according to the national development.
4. Furthermore, the user can choose to investigate the impact of more or less â€“ relative to the selected scenario - ambitious measures, e.g. choose a higher or lower demolition rate of buildings from a certain construction period.


**Output**

* Tabular results on heated gross floor area per construction period, final energy demand per construction period and derived indicators.
* Bar charts on heated gross floor area and final energy demand per construction period
* Heat density map and map of heated gross floor area
